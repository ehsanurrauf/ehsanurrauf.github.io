    <h3>1. Crop Diversification and its Impact on Income Diversification and Crop Income in Bangladesh</h3>
    <p><strong>Journal:</strong> Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (Taylor & Francis), 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates the determinants and extent of crop diversification and its impact on farm households’ income and income diversification in rural Bangladesh, utilizing data from 450 households across the districts of Manikganj, Tangail, and Gaibandha. The findings reveal moderate to high levels of crop and income diversification across these sites. Using a Tobit model, the study identifies significant socio-economic factors influencing crop diversification, including literacy, farm size, and market distance. Additionally, it shows that crop diversification intensity, the household head’s age and education, and on- and off-farm income significantly affect income diversification. These factors, along with farm size, also significantly impact crop income. This research addresses a significant gap in the literature by exploring the underexamined interaction between crop diversification and income diversification in Bangladesh. It contributes to a broader understanding of how diversification strategies can enhance agricultural productivity and income stability and offers valuable policy implications.</p>

    <h3>2. The Threshold Effcet of Institutional Quality on Sovereign Debt and Economic Stability</h3>
    <p><strong>Journal:</strong> Joural of Policy Modelling (Elsevier), 2024</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>This study examines the threshold effect of institutional quality on the sovereign debt-macroeconomic stability nexus using panel data from 133 countries covering the period from 2002 to 2020. We measure macroeconomic stability using principal component analysis of budget deficit, annual inflation rate, official exchange rate, real interest rate, and unemployment rate. The dynamic GMM result shows that institutional quality has a positive effect on macroeconomic stability, while government debt has a negative effect. However, the interaction between institutional quality and government debt changes the direction of the effect of debt on macroeconomic stability. Moreover, in dynamic panel threshold regression, we document the evidence of the threshold effect of institutional quality on sovereign debt-macroeconomic stability nexus and suggest that before (after) the threshold level of institutional quality, there is a negative (positive) impact of debt on macroeconomic stability. Our result suggest that better institutions can use debt more efficiently and productively to enhance economic performance. The findings of this study have significant implications for policymakers in formulating policies to promote macroeconomic stability.</p>

    <h3>3. An Investigation into the Spatial Rice Market Integration in Bangladesh: Application of Vector Error Correction Approach</h3>
    <p><strong>Journal:</strong> Asian Development Perspectives (Institute for Poverty Alleviation and International Development, Yonsei University, South Korea), 2023</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Market integration is a metric for market efficiency, notably pricing efficiency. This paper examined the type and degree of market integration in Bangladesh using latest available weekly rice market price data from the six district markets in Bangladesh from January 2014 to December 2018. The findings demonstrated that the wholesale price series of rice are stationary at first difference, but non-stationary at levels. The vector error correction model is then implemented after the Johansen-Juselius approach has been used to examine the co-integrating relationship between the various district markets. The negative and statistically significant coefficients of error correction term for the rice markets in Barishal, Chattogram, and Sylhet districts show that short-run dynamics are convergent with long-term equilibrium. According to the estimated results of the error correction model, there is an equilibrium relationship between the rice markets in Dhaka with rice markets in Barishal, Chattogram, Dinajpur, and Khulna over the long run. In the short run, the calculated co-efficient values, however, indicate that there is only a weak transmission of price changes from one district market to another within the same week.</p>

    <h3>4. An Analysis of the Impacts of Inflation, Trade Openness, and Exchange Rate on Foreign Direct Investment in Bangladesh and Some Selected Emerging Countries</h3>
    <p><strong>Journal:</strong> Thoughts on Banking and Finance (Bangladesh Bank Training Academy), 2017</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper investigates the impacts of inflation, trade openness and exchange rate on foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, and Turkey.Johansen-Juselius (1988) procedure is applied to test the cointegration relationship among the variables followed by the Vector Error Correction model. The empirical results trace a long-run equilibrium relationship in the variables. Among the three independent variables, inflation and exchange rate are found as important factors in explaining the changes in FDI inflows in both short-run and long-run.Therefore, the challenge before the central banks of these emerging countries including Bangladesh is to maintain a stable and realistic exchange rate that will boost domestic production, increase FDI and maintain internal and external balance. In order to protect external competitiveness, it is necessary to intervene in the domestic foreign exchange market by the concerned central banks. As trade openness is a means of themarket- related economic determinant regarding attracting FDI inflow in thehost country, so trade policy vis-a-vis monetary and fiscal policies should be made proactive considering the global perspectives.</p>

    <h3>5. An Analysis of the Impacts of Temperature on Diarrheal Disease in Bangladesh</h3>
    <p><strong>Journal:</strong> International Journal of Social Science and Economic Research, 2017</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>This paper analyses the impacts of temperature on diarrheal disease in Bangladesh using district wise monthly average temperature and diarrhea (affected) data from Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), Bangladesh Economic Review and World Food Programme (WFP) (1998-2010). Generalized Least Square (GLS) is used as estimation method is used to see whether temperature has impact on the number of diarrhea patients in Bangladesh and Optimization method is used to find maximum and minimum temperatures where diarrhea patients are found maximum and minimum respectively. Using results of the study, precautions and steps can be taken to minimize number of affected people due to diarrhea in the diarrhea-prone months.</p>

    <h3>6. An Analysis of the Demand for Money in Bangladesh: Partial Adjustment and Vector Error Correction (VEC) Approach</h3>
    <p><strong>Journal:</strong> Asian Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies, 2017</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>This paper examines the determinants of demand for money in Bangladesh using yearly data from 1975-2016. Partial adjustment model and vector error correction model have been used to examine the nature of short run and long run determinants and short run dynamics. Impulse Response Analysis has been performed by giving a shock to real per capita GDP, inflation, real interest rate, degree of monetization and real exchange rate to visualize the duration of their effects on the real narrow money (M1) and real broad money (M2) in Bangladesh. The results of partial adjustment model in the study suggest that only real M1 follows partial adjustment mechanism. Real per capita GDP and degree of monetization have positive effects on money demand in Bangladesh whereas real exchange rate has negative effect on money demand in Bangladesh which implies that the currency substitution effect is less than the asset substitution effect. The Johansen-Juselius procedure is applied to test the co integration relationship between variables and it is followed by the VEC (Vector Error Correction) regression model. The empirical results of the study trace a long-run equilibrium relationship in the variables for real narrow money in Bangladesh. </p>

    <h3>7. What Factors Affect Household Decision's to Send Children to Formal School?</h3>
    <p><strong>Journal:</strong> Asian Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies, 2017</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>This paper analyzed the factors which affect household‟ s decision to send children to formal school in Bangladesh. Insight into the factors affecting household‟ s decision to send children to formal school will help policy-makers to redirect education related strategies and policies in more efficient directions. A total of 5,461 cross-sectional observations from Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (2005) are used to estimate a logistic regression model. Results of the study shows that education level of female member of the household and number of children having chronic illness in household, location of the household and household size have significant affect on the probability of household‟ s decision to send children to formal school. One of the major findings of the paper is household‟ s decision to send children to formal school is income neutral in Bangladesh which reflects the success of the Bangladesh Government‟ s policy on education over the years. This paper also found that household type ie whether a household is agricultural or non agricultural do not affect household‟ s decision to send children to formal school. The paper ends by making several policy-relevant recommendations.</p>

    <h3>8. Inclusive Growth: Dimension of Financial Inclusion in Bangladesh What Factors Affect Household Decision's to Send Children to Formal School?</h3>
    <p><strong>Journal:</strong> Bangladesh Journal of Political Economy (Bangladesh Economic Association), 2015</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>Financial inclusion, has a great role to play for promoting inclusive growth. Financial inclusion ensures access to a well-functioning financial system, by creating equal opportunities, enables economically and socially excluded people to integrate better into the economy and actively contribute to development and protect themselves against economic shocks. Financial inclusion leads to greater asset accumulation by the poor and it is also associated with pro-poor growth. Poverty reduction and promoting inclusive growth are the most important policy priorities of the government of Bangladesh. In this paper an attempt has been made to discuss the various dimensions of financial inclusion in Bangladesh for promoting inclusive growth. Due to heterogeneity of socio-economic structures, there are diverging views and different solutions in different countries. So, individual countries need to design their own national strategies for inclusive growth and inclusive financial sector development. Bangladesh Bank (central bank of Bangladesh) has been contributing to the government’s efforts to speed up inclusive growth through its financial inclusive campaign in the country. Progress has been achieved in financial inclusion in Bangladesh but many remains still to be done in deepening financial inclusion. It is imperative to design a long-run strategy for inclusive financial sector in Bangladesh for promoting sustainable inclusive growth as well as for overall economic development of the country.</p>
