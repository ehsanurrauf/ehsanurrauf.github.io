    <h3>1. Crop Diversification and its Impact on Income Diversification and Crop Income in Bangladesh</h3>
    <p><strong>Journal:</strong> Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (Taylor & Francis), 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates the determinants and extent of crop diversification and its impact on farm households’ income and income diversification in rural Bangladesh, utilizing data from 450 households across the districts of Manikganj, Tangail, and Gaibandha. The findings reveal moderate to high levels of crop and income diversification across these sites. Using a Tobit model, the study identifies significant socio-economic factors influencing crop diversification, including literacy, farm size, and market distance. Additionally, it shows that crop diversification intensity, the household head’s age and education, and on- and off-farm income significantly affect income diversification. These factors, along with farm size, also significantly impact crop income. This research addresses a significant gap in the literature by exploring the underexamined interaction between crop diversification and income diversification in Bangladesh. It contributes to a broader understanding of how diversification strategies can enhance agricultural productivity and income stability and offers valuable policy implications.</p>

    <h3>2. The Threshold Effcet of Institutional Quality on Sovereign Debt and Economic Stability</h3>
    <p><strong>Journal:</strong> Joural of Policy Modelling (Elsevier), 2024</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>Market integration is a metric for market efficiency, notably pricing efficiency. This paper examined the type and degree of market integration in Bangladesh using latest available weekly rice market price data from the six district markets in Bangladesh from January 2014 to December 2018. The findings demonstrated that the wholesale price series of rice are stationary at first difference, but non-stationary at levels. The vector error correction model is then implemented after the Johansen-Juselius approach has been used to examine the co-integrating relationship between the various district markets. The negative and statistically significant coefficients of error correction term for the rice markets in Barishal, Chattogram, and Sylhet districts show that short-run dynamics are convergent with long-term equilibrium. According to the estimated results of the error correction model, there is an equilibrium relationship between the rice markets in Dhaka with rice markets in Barishal, Chattogram, Dinajpur, and Khulna over the long run. In the short run, the calculated co-efficient values, however, indicate that there is only a weak transmission of price changes from one district market to another within the same week.</p>

    <h3>3. An Investigation into the Spatial Rice Market Integration in Bangladesh: Application of Vector Error Correction Approach</h3>
    <p><strong>Journal:</strong> Asian Development Perspectives (Institute for Poverty Alleviation and International Development, Yonsei University, South Korea), 2023</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study examines the threshold effect of institutional quality on the sovereign debt-macroeconomic stability nexus using panel data from 133 countries covering the period from 2002 to 2020. We measure macroeconomic stability using principal component analysis of budget deficit, annual inflation rate, official exchange rate, real interest rate, and unemployment rate. The dynamic GMM result shows that institutional quality has a positive effect on macroeconomic stability, while government debt has a negative effect. However, the interaction between institutional quality and government debt changes the direction of the effect of debt on macroeconomic stability. Moreover, in dynamic panel threshold regression, we document the evidence of the threshold effect of institutional quality on sovereign debt-macroeconomic stability nexus and suggest that before (after) the threshold level of institutional quality, there is a negative (positive) impact of debt on macroeconomic stability. Our result suggest that better institutions can use debt more efficiently and productively to enhance economic performance. The findings of this study have significant implications for policymakers in formulating policies to promote macroeconomic stability.</p>
